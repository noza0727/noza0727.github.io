                            In 1895, Dracula builds a resort in Transylvania,
                            hidden from the humans, to raise his beloved daughter
                            Mavis in a safe environment. In the present, the place
                            is the Hotel Transylvania, where monsters bring their
                            families to vacation far from the frightening humans.
                            Dracula invites his friends to celebrate the 118th
                            birthday of Mavis. When the party is ready to start,
                            the 21-year-old Jonathan is walking through the forest
                            and stumbles upon the hotel. Dracula sees Jonathan and
                            disguises him as a monster to hide Jonathan from the
                            guests. But Mavis also sees Jonathan and Dracula forces
                            him to pose as a monster. Soon Mavis believes that
                            Jonathan is the "zing" of her life despite the advice
                            of her father about humans.

                            Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons
                            presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes,
                            he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when
                            Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy
                            combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of
                            shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order
                            to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery
                            and figures out that the battery can power something else.
                            Thus Iron Man is born.
